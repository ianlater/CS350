I. Requirements:
+Overview
Design and Implement syscalls in order to separate user and kernel code. Ensure that user can do nothing to violate security
of data (eg. access physical memory directly, cause OS to crash). After implementing syscalls, we update the Passport office
to be a user program only using this syscalls, and ran two processes of it.
